# Employee-will-leave-the-company-or-not
This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques by analyzing various features such as job satisfaction, salary, work-life balance, and performance ratings, this project seeks to determine whether an employee is likely to leave the company or not.

The dataset used for this project contains information about employees' demographics, job-related factors, and satisfaction levels. By leveraging decision tree algorithms and ensemble methods like random forests, the model will learn patterns in the data to make predictions about future attrition.

Key Features:

Dataset Exploration: Understanding the structure and content of the dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for modeling.

Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features that contribute to employee attrition prediction.

Model Building: Implementing decision tree and random forest classifiers to train predictive models.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model parameters to improve performance and generalization.

Deployment: Deploying the trained model to make real-time predictions or integrating it into existing systems.

Through this project, users can gain insights into the factors influencing employee attrition and develop strategies to mitigate turnover, ultimately contributing to organizational success and employee retention efforts.The code and documentation will be made available on GitHub for anyone interested in replicating the project or exploring further.
